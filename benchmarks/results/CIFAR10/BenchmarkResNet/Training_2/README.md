### Hyperparams
- Torch.seed = 0
- Epochs = 140
- Batch_size = 128
- Learning Rate = 0.1
- Best Train Accuracy:
    - Step = 53667.0
    - Train Accuracy = 99.2266
    - Train loss = 0.027668
- Best Test Accuracy:
    - Epoch = 131.0
    - Train Accuracy = ***93.3800***
    - Train loss = 0.245752
    
- Training time = 23182.52s â‰ˆ 386 min

#### Hence our Best Model has an error of 6.62 % which is very close to the 6.43 % of ResNet paper.
